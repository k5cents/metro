Description: The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority
    is the government agency that operates the light rail and passenger
    buses of the Washington D.C. area. Developers can use their free API
    to access train arrivals, bus predictions, schedules, and more. The
    JSON data returned from that API is parsed as data frames for easy
    analysis. Users must register for a free developer account to obtain
    an API key.
